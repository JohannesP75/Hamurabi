This is the C porting of the classic game Hamurabi,
undertaken from October 25th to October 31st of the year 2014.

== History of the game ==

== History of the devellopment ==

On October 24th, the .bas file was recuperated on the Net and, the day after,
the project officialy began by the creation of .c and .h files and then the coding of the functions.

The major difficulty was the "spaghetti coding" which was prevalent during the 1960s and the 1970s, before structured
programming; directing oneself between the GOTOs was very difficult, which explained why the input-output functions,
that is, the functions coding for the relations between the player and the game, all regrouped in io.c and .h,
were coded before the mechanisms in city.c and .h

== Rules ==

The game features a town, composed from its inhabitants and the fields it possess.
You must rule the town for the ten years of your term, managing the distribution of the grain supply between sowing,
feeding your people, buying land por simply stocking - beware of the rats which could eat your grain in he silos!
The more grain and land you have, the more migrants you will get in your town
and the more workers - and eaters! - will you get.

The ending depends of your management, that is, the numbers of death by hunger and the amount of land by citizen
in the hand of your term.
